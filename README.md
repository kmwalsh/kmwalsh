# Hi. I am Kate. I am an exceptional~~ly strange~~ WordPress developer. 

I have been doing weird computer stuff since approximately 2001. At some point, some foolish people even decided to pay me to do it. Ask me basically anything. I promise the nonsense I babble will be at least partially useful.

I live in the great Garden State of New Jersey. I like cats, technology, memes, poker, reading, gaming, and a great many other wonderful things. 🐈‍⬛💻📕🎮
