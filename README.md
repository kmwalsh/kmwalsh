Hi, I am Kate. I have been doing weird stuff with computers since approximately 2001. At some point, some people even decided to pay me for it. Technology is my jams and I like pretty much everything related to solving problems. I greatly enjoy WordPress, Laravel, PHP, Bash, Git, and front end stuff like JavaScript, CSS and Sass, and more. I run the gamut from accessibility auditing and remediation -- to security-relevant things. I'm mostly on macOS, but I also speak Windows and a little server-relevant Linux. 

I've worked in freelance, in-house, agency, and start-up environments. I have several years of remote work experience. I work for [ClickUp](https://clickup.com/).

I live in the great Garden State of New Jersey. I like cats, technology, memes, cards, reading, gaming, and a great many other wonderful things. 🐈‍⬛💻📕🎮
