# Hi. I am Kate. I am an exceptional~~ly strange~~ WordPress engineer. 

You may call me Kate or Sie (like sea, not sigh). Katesie is also acceptable in a pinch.

I have been doing weird computer stuff since approximately 2001. At some point, some foolish people even decided to pay me for it. I like pretty much everything related to technology and solving problems with technology. Development-wise, I enjoy WordPress, Laravel, PHP, Bash, Git, and a bunch of front end stuff like CSS and Sass, too. JavaScript, email, and marketing/analytics are painful but I endure. Accessibility is a jam, but I mostly prefer the technical aspects of implementation. Ages ago, I even did some design stuff. I mostly do work on macOS, but I can sorta swing Windows and I know some Linux things (sort of) for server administration. Technology is my jams, I love it.

I've worked in freelance, in-house, agency, and start-up environments. I have several years of remote work experience. At the moment I've been working for [Kanopi Studios](https://kanopi.com/) for a few years -- it's a great remote place to exist. I don't really know why they put up with me, but they totally do. 😉

Ask me basically anything. I greatly enjoy babbling nonsense, and I promise my nonsense is at least partially useful.

I live in the great Garden State of New Jersey. I like cats, technology, memes, poker, reading, gaming, and a great many other wonderful things. 🐈‍⬛💻📕🎮
