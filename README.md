# Hi. I am Kate. I am an exceptional~~ly strange~~ WordPress engineer. 

You may call me Kate or Sie (like sea, not sigh). Katesie is also acceptable in a pinch.

I have been doing weird computer stuff since approximately 2001. At some point, some foolish people even decided to pay me for it. I've worked in freelance, in-house, agency, and start-up environments. I have several years of remote work experience. Ask me basically anything. I greatly enjoy babbling nonsense, and I promise my nonsense is at least partially useful.

I live in the great Garden State of New Jersey. I like cats, technology, memes, poker, reading, gaming, and a great many other wonderful things. 🐈‍⬛💻📕🎮
